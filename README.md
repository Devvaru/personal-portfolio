 A portfolio showcasing my web development projects and web design assets.


## **This portfolio was built utilizing:**
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- A mobile first approach

And deployed via **gh-pages**.

I consider this project a portfolio piece in itself, showcasing skills in state management, carousels, modals, and web design.

- Adding a grid/tile view for the projects section
- Adding a contact form
- Improving the banner design to highlight call to action
- Minor fixes to image layouts and improving navigation for all devices
